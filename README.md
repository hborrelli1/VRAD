## VRAD!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is a clone of airBnB where the user can view different areas of Denver and view house listings available for rent. The user has the option to favorite individual listings and refer back to those at a later date.

### Learning Goals
- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
- Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data.
- Become familiar with routing and how to handle dynamic routes.
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Write tests for React components and some asynchronous functionality.

- Create an app relying on clean code practices
